4 groups of channels 
injecting pulses not all at once but in groups

we read where the pulses ok
group 0
channel 0, 4, 8, 12

group 1 
1, 5, 9, 13

etc...

each group has 32 ch, in total 128 ch

the threshold corresponds to the 1st discriminator threshold
the digitization threshold (for DAQ)

gain is the slope of a calibrated channel (before calibration there's no gain)

extra noisy channels marked for information

cleaning a bit of scripts, improving

noise level: ID broken channels
