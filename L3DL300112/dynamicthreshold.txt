dynamic threshold based on average of plus minus 5 channels around this channel 
odd and even channels separately


ios::in	Open for input operations.
ios::out	Open for output operations.

ios::app	All output operations are performed at the end of the file, appending the content to the current content of the file.



threshold: window +/- 5 % positive (if it includes positve then also the negative)
average / max amplitude 

suspicious almost above threshold

ADC in th2d 
projection of Y axis sum over bins take weighted average or median

add a condition for problematic channels

Do a scan to determine the optimal conditions for putting the threshold
number of broken channels vs neighboring channels (to put a threshold)
neighboring channels vs threshold in % in th2d


criteria separate for each channel based on weighted average
